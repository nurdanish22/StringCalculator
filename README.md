# StringCalculator
Nurdanish "Trigger" | OOP Assignment 1

PROJECT: String Calculator
Description: Develop a string calculator to calculate any given values with mathematical
symbols. The output should contain the counts for numbers, math symbols, and invalid symbols, as well as the result of the calculation (if valid).

String calculator requirements:
a. Only numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are considered valid and allowed
for calculation.
b. Only mathematical (+, -, *, /, %) symbols are considered valid and allowed
for calculation.
c. Any repetitive numbers (11, 21, 30, etc.) are considered double-digit
numbers and valid for calculation.

Notes
1. Use a split() method to convert the string into an array or character.
2. Format the output to two (2) decimal places by using a String.format() method.
